Did not enclude data file: Lexicon_And_WE/glove.twitter.27B/  -- It's too big. This word embedding can be downloaded from their website.
	(But I only used word embeddings of a dimension of 25 to keep it fast, ideally it should be around 2-300 dimension)

PS: Use as you wish but please do not copy for CS918 coursework.
